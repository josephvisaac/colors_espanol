name: colors_espanol
description: This Flutter project turns Colors.red and all other colors into spanish. Instead of Colors.red, you'd use Colores.rojo, Colores.azul, Colores.verde, Colors.etc. Every color has been translated, and this includes the shades like black##. It works identically do Colors except it isn't available for the ThemeData sadly, but it works for any other Widget that isn't directly affecting the Material App theme. It works on Containers of all shapes and types. Use it like a regular Colors widget. Este paquete funciona identicamente a Colors. Usenlo como usan Colors. Todos los colores han sido traducidos. Green es verde, orange es naranja, pink es rosado, marron es brown, etcetera. Disfruten:)

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
